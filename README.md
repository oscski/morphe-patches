## 🧑‍💻 Dev usage

To develop and release these patches:

- **Make all changes to the `dev` branch.**
- For local development work build your patches using the gradle task `./gradlew buildAndroid` to generate the mpp file found in `patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp`. Apply your patches locally using Morphe Desktop tool like any other patch bundle.
- Always use [Semantic commit](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Semantic_Commits.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index) messages for commits. To keep it simple use only 3 commit message types:
  - `feat: Added a new feature`
  - `fix: Some problem now fixed`
  - `chore: Random change you do not want in the user facing changelog`
- Commits of `fix:` and `feat:` will automatically generate new pre-releases and `chore:` will not create a new release.
- Users can apply your dev branch releases by enabling `pre-release` in Morphe Manager patch sources.
- When your dev branch is ready, and you want a stable release, merge dev branch to main (do not squash, and only merge).
- **Always use semantic release (release.yml)**. Do not manually upload or create releases by hand
  because many files must be updated and release.yml handles everything.

## 🤓 Tips

- See the [patcher documentation](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patcher/blob/main/docs/1_patcher_intro.md) for more examples of creating patches and fingerprints.
- Do not use AI to create new release scripts. The `release.yml` here already handles everything.
  If you need something custom with your releases then modify the existing `release.yml`
  and `.releaserc` instead of writing everything new from scratch.
- Do not manually edit or manually commit any generated files such as: `patches-list.json`,
  `patches-bundle.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`. These files will be automatically updated by `release.yml`.
- Do not force push any semantic release commits as that will break all future releases.
  If you need to fix a broken release, it's always easiest to create a new release instead of
  fixing an existing release.

### 🛠️ Building locally

- Run `./gradlew buildAndroid`
- The built patches .mpp file is found in `patches/build/libs/patches-*.mpp`
- Patch the mpp file using [Morphe-Desktop](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-desktop)
  like any other patch bundle.

See the [Morphe documentation](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-documentation) for more information.
